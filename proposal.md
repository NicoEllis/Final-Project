# Drawing with Shapes and Colors

## Repository
<https://github.com/NicoEllis/Final-Project.git>

## Description
This program will allow the user to click on the window and shapes will appear where they choose. This will allow them to create drawings and pictures.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- This will create the draw action
- Feature 2
	- This will use Feature 1 to make it function with user input

## Challenges
- I want to let the user pick out the color or shape they want to do so I will need to research how to attatch certain colors or shapes to hotkeys
- I will use the skills learned from the digital rain project to create my final project

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The user is able to create a drawing of their choosing with customizable options to increase creativity

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I will need knowledge of the code I have learned from class, as well as research that will aid my project
